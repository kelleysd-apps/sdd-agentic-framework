## SDD Agentic Framework Evolution

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Framework:** Specification-Driven Development (SDD) Agentic Framework  
**Repository:** https://github.com/kelleysd-apps/sdd-agentic-framework  
**Reference:** Google AI DS-STAR Multi-Agent System

---

## Executive Summary

This Statement of Work outlines the implementation of proven multi-agent patterns from Google's DS-STAR system into the SDD Agentic Framework. The enhancements will add iterative refinement, automated verification, intelligent routing, and self-healing capabilities while maintaining constitutional compliance and specification-driven principles.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 3.5x improvement in task completion accuracy
- Automated quality gates at each workflow stage
- Self-healing code through automatic debugging
- Intelligent agent orchestration and routing
- Context-aware agent decision making

---

## Constitutional Alignment

These enhancements align with and strengthen the framework's constitutional principles:

**Article I - Library-First Development:** Enhanced analyzer agent ensures proper library usage before code generation

**Article III - Test-First Development:** Verification agent enforces TDD compliance with binary quality gates

**Article IV - Integration Testing:** Iterative refinement ensures integration tests pass before progression

**Article V - Observability:** Router and verification agents log all decisions for complete audit trails

**Article VI - Versioning Strategy:** Finalizer agent ensures version compliance before commits

**Article VII - Simplicity:** Each new agent has a single, clear responsibility

- Integration test result verification
- Code quality assessment against standards

**Capabilities:**
- Receives: Current plan, query/specification, code, execution results
- Returns: Binary decision with detailed reasoning
- Logs: All decisions to `.docs/agents/quality/verifier/decisions/`
- Triggers: Automatically invoked at workflow stage transitions

**Integration Points:**
- After `/specify` - Validates specification completeness

- Agent collaboration coordination

**Capabilities:**
- Analyzes task complexity and current state
- Determines appropriate agent(s) for invocation
- Decides refinement strategy on failures
- Routes to debugging when errors detected
- Coordinates multi-agent collaboration

**Decision Matrix:**
```
State: Specification incomplete
  → Action: ADD_STEP
  → Route: Product Agent for requirements gathering

State: Plan has errors
  → Action: TRUNCATE_FROM(step_index)
  → Route: Architecture Agent for redesign

State: Code execution failed
  → Action: ROUTE_TO_DEBUG
  → Route: Auto-Debug Agent

State: Tests failing
  → Action: RETRY_WITH_FEEDBACK
  → Route: Engineering Agent with test results
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Reduces unnecessary agent invocations
- Optimizes parallel execution opportunities
- Routes failures to appropriate recovery agents
- Maintains audit trail of routing decisions

#### 1.3 Auto-Debug Agent (Engineering Department)

**Capabilities:**
- Receives: Failed code, stack trace, execution context, specs
- Analyzes: Error patterns, constitutional violations, spec misalignment
- Generates: Corrected code with explanations
- Validates: Re-runs tests after repair
- Limits: Max 5 debug iterations before escalation

**Process Flow:**
```
1. Capture execution error + full context
2. Analyze against:
   - Specification requirements
   - Constitutional principles
   - Code dependencies
   - Test expectations
3. Generate fix with reasoning
4. Apply fix and re-run tests
5. If still failing, iterate (max 5x)

Implementation:
  Loop until tests pass OR max_rounds:
    1. Generate/refine code
    2. Run tests + verify
    3. If failed: Auto-Debug or refine
    4. If passed: proceed to next task
```

**Success Criteria:**
