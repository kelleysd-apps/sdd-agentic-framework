# Deployment Policy

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Effective Date**: 2025-11-07
**Authority**: Constitution v1.5.0 - Principle VII (Observability)
**Review Cycle**: Quarterly

---

## Purpose

This policy establishes deployment standards, procedures, and safeguards for the SDD Framework, ensuring reliable, observable, and reversible deployments following constitutional principles.

---

## Constitutional Alignment

This policy enforces:
- **Principle IV**: Idempotent Operations - Deployments are repeatable and safe
- **Principle V**: Progressive Enhancement - Gradual rollout and feature flags
- **Principle VI**: Git Operation Approval - No autonomous deployments
- **Principle VII**: Observability - All deployments logged and monitored
- **Principle IX**: Dependency Management - Dependencies declared and verified

---

## Scope

All deployments to production and production-like environments must follow this policy, including:
- Application code deployments
- Infrastructure changes
- Database migrations
- Configuration updates
- Dependency updates
- Hotfixes and patches

---

## Deployment Principles

### 1. Zero-Downtime Deployments

**Requirement**: Deployments must not cause service interruptions

**Strategies**:
- Blue-green deployments
- Rolling deployments
- Canary deployments
- Feature flags for new functionality

### 2. Automated Deployments

**Requirement**: Manual deployments are discouraged; automation is preferred

**Benefits**:
- Consistency and repeatability
- Reduced human error
- Faster deployment cycles
- Clear audit trail

### 3. Rollback Capability

**Requirement**: Every deployment must have a rollback plan

**Requirements**:
- Rollback procedure documented
- Rollback tested in staging
- Rollback executable within 5 minutes
- Database migrations reversible

### 4. Progressive Rollout

**Requirement**: New versions deployed gradually, not all-at-once

**Stages**:
1. Development environment
2. Staging environment
3. Production canary (1-5% traffic)
4. Production partial (25% traffic)
5. Production full (100% traffic)

---

## Deployment Environments

- Integration testing

**Deployment**: Automatic on push to `staging` branch

**Requirements**:
- All tests pass
- Performance benchmarks meet targets
- Security scan passes

### Production (prod)

**Purpose**: Live user-facing environment

**Characteristics**:
- Stable releases only
- Real user data
- High availability
- Full monitoring
- Disaster recovery

**Deployment**: Manual trigger after approval

**Requirements**:
- Staging deployment successful for ≥24 hours
- All smoke tests pass
- Team approval obtained
- Rollback plan documented
- Runbook updated

---

## Deployment Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Checks

**Required Checks**:
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Security scan clear
- [ ] Performance benchmarks acceptable
- [ ] Database migration tested
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Deployment runbook updated

**Automated Checks** (CI/CD):
```yaml
pre-deployment:
  - run: npm test
  - run: npm run lint
  - run: npm audit
  - run: npm run build
  - run: npm run test:e2e
```

### Step 2: Deployment Approval

**Approval Requirements**:

| Deployment Type | Approvers Required | Notice Period |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Hotfix | 1 (on-call engineer) | Immediate |
| Minor release | 1 (team lead) | 4 hours |
| Major release | 2 (team lead + architect) | 24 hours |
| Breaking change | Team consensus | 48 hours |

**Approval Process**:
1. Create deployment request (ticket/issue)
2. Notify required approvers
3. Wait for approval
4. Proceed with deployment

### Step 3: Database Migrations

**If database changes required**:

1. **Create Migration**:
   ```bash
   npm run migration:create -- add_users_table
   ```

2. **Test Migration** (staging):
   ```bash
   npm run migration:up    # Apply
   npm run migration:down  # Rollback
   npm run migration:up    # Re-apply
   ```

3. **Backup Production Database**:
   ```bash
   pg_dump production > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

4. **Run Migration** (production):
   ```bash
   npm run migration:up
   ```

**Migration Requirements**:
- Migrations are reversible
- Migrations are idempotent
- Migrations tested in staging
- Database backed up before migration

### Step 4: Deployment Execution

**Blue-Green Deployment** (Recommended):
```bash
# 1. Deploy to green environment
deploy-to-environment green

# 2. Run smoke tests on green
run-smoke-tests green

# 3. Switch traffic to green
switch-traffic blue -> green

# 4. Monitor for 10 minutes
monitor-health-checks

# 5. If healthy: decommission blue
# 6. If issues: switch back to blue (rollback)
```

**Rolling Deployment** (Alternative):
```bash
# 1. Deploy to 1 instance
deploy-to-instance instance-1

# 2. Health check
if healthy:
  # 3. Deploy to remaining instances gradually
  deploy-to-instance instance-2
  deploy-to-instance instance-3
  # ...
```

**Canary Deployment** (New features):
```bash
# 1. Deploy canary with feature flag
deploy-canary --feature-flag=new_feature

# 2. Route 5% traffic to canary
set-traffic-split canary=5% stable=95%

# 3. Monitor metrics for 1 hour
monitor-canary-metrics

# 4. If healthy: gradually increase
set-traffic-split canary=25% stable=75%
set-traffic-split canary=50% stable=50%
set-traffic-split canary=100% stable=0%

# 5. If issues: rollback
set-traffic-split canary=0% stable=100%
```

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Verification

**Smoke Tests** (Must pass):
- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] Critical user flows work (login, core features)
- [ ] No error spikes in logs

**Monitoring Checks** (First 10 minutes):
- [ ] Error rate < baseline + 10%
- [ ] Response time < baseline + 20%
- [ ] CPU/Memory within normal range
- [ ] No database connection errors
- [ ] No 5xx errors

**If Issues Detected**:
1. Execute rollback immediately
2. Investigate root cause
3. Fix issue
4. Re-test in staging
5. Retry deployment

### Step 6: Deployment Communication

**Announce Deployment**:
```markdown
📢 Deployment Announcement

Environment: Production
Version: v1.2.3
Deployed By: [Name]
Deployed At: 2025-11-07 14:30 UTC

Changes:
- Added user profile feature
- Fixed password reset bug
- Updated dependencies

Rollback Plan: Documented in runbook
Monitoring: https://monitoring-dashboard-link

Status: ✅ Healthy
```

**Communication Channels**:
- Team Slack/chat
- Status page (if user-facing)
- Deployment log/dashboard

---

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

Rollback immediately if:
- Error rate > baseline + 50%
- Response time > baseline + 100%
- Critical feature broken
- Data corruption detected
- Security vulnerability exposed

### Rollback Execution

**Application Rollback**:
```bash
# Blue-Green: Switch traffic back
switch-traffic green -> blue

# Rolling: Deploy previous version
deploy-version v1.2.2

# Canary: Route to stable
set-traffic-split canary=0% stable=100%
```

**Database Rollback**:
```bash
# Run down migration
npm run migration:down

# Or restore from backup (if migration not reversible)
psql production < backup_20251107_143000.sql
```

**Rollback Timeline**:
- Decision: Within 2 minutes of issue detection
- Execution: Within 5 minutes of decision
- Verification: Within 3 minutes of execution
- Total: ≤10 minutes from detection to stable

### Post-Rollback

After rollback:
1. **Announce**: Notify team and users of rollback
2. **Investigate**: Root cause analysis
3. **Fix**: Address the issue
4. **Test**: Verify fix in staging
5. **Document**: Update runbook with learnings
6. **Retry**: Schedule new deployment

---

## Feature Flags

### Purpose

Feature flags enable:
- Gradual rollout to subset of users
- A/B testing
- Quick disabling of problematic features
- Decoupling deployment from release

### Implementation

```typescript
// Feature flag configuration
const featureFlags = {
  newUserProfile: {
    enabled: true,
    rollout: 25, // 25% of users
    environments: ['staging', 'production']
  }
};

// Usage in code
if (featureFlags.isEnabled('newUserProfile', user)) {
  // Show new profile
} else {
  // Show old profile
}
```

### Feature Flag Management

**Best Practices**:
- Default to disabled for new features
- Start with small rollout percentage
- Monitor metrics during rollout
- Remove flags after full rollout
- Don't accumulate technical debt (clean up flags)

**Flag Lifecycle**:
1. Create flag (disabled, 0% rollout)
2. Enable in staging
3. Enable in production (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
4. Remove flag after stable
