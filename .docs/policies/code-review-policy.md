## Review Process

### 1. Author Preparation

Before requesting review:
1. Run all tests locally (`npm test` or equivalent)
2. Run linter (`npm run lint`)
3. Run constitutional compliance check: `.specify/scripts/bash/constitutional-check.sh`
4. Update documentation
5. Self-review changes
6. Write descriptive PR description

### 2. Review Request

Create pull request with:
- **Title**: Clear, concise description
- **Description**:
  - What changed and why
  - How to test
  - Screenshots (if UI changes)
  - Constitutional compliance notes
- **Reviewers**: Assign appropriate domain experts
- **Labels**: Add relevant labels (feature, bug, security, etc.)

### 3. Reviewer Responsibilities

Reviewers must:
1. Review within **24 hours** (or notify of delay)
2. Use review checklist above
3. Leave constructive, actionable feedback
4. Approve, request changes, or comment
5. Re-review after changes

### 4. Addressing Feedback

Authors must:
1. Respond to all comments
2. Make requested changes or explain why not
3. Request re-review after updates
4. Resolve conversations as addressed

### 5. Approval & Merge

Requirements for merge:
- ✅ All required approvals received
- ✅ All CI/CD checks passing
- ✅ All conversations resolved
- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ Constitutional compliance verified

**Merge Strategy**: Squash merge preferred for feature branches

## Review Guidelines

### For Reviewers

**DO**:
- ✅ Be respectful and constructive
- ✅ Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- ✅ Praise good code
- ✅ Ask questions to understand intent
- ✅ Suggest alternatives, not just problems
- ✅ Focus on important issues first

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Nitpick style if linter handles it
- ❌ Block on personal preference (unless constitutional)
- ❌ Request changes without explanation
- ❌ Approve without actually reviewing
- ❌ Be condescending or rude

### For Authors

**DO**:
- ✅ Keep PRs small and focused
- ✅ Respond promptly to feedback
- ✅ Be open to suggestions
- ✅ Explain reasoning if disagreeing
- ✅ Test thoroughly before requesting review

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Submit huge PRs (>500 lines)
- ❌ Mix unrelated changes
- ❌ Get defensive about feedback
- ❌ Ignore comments
- ❌ Force push after review started
