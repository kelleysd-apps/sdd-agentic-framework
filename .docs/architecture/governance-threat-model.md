# Governance Threat Model & Enforcement Posture

**Status:** v6.6.2 · **Scope:** the hook-enforced governance core.

LogicLoom's governance is **hook-enforced** (model-independent), but hooks are a
**porous floor, not a sandbox**. This document states honestly what the
enforcement layer does and does **not** cover, so governance is never
mis-marketed as airtight (cf. Claude Code RFC #45427, which documents PreToolUse
bypass modes that Anthropic declined to close in-CLI — the hardening burden is
the harness author's).

## Defense-in-depth layers

Governance is one layer among several; rely on the stack, not any single gate:

1. **Permissions** (allow/deny/ask in settings) — coarse daily policy.
2. **PreToolUse hooks** (this layer) — deterministic, model-independent policy at the tool boundary.
3. **MCP allowlists** — tool-surface governance.
4. **Sandboxing** — blast-radius limit. A **host** capability (Claude Code's
   built-in Bash sandbox), opt-in and off by default; LogicLoom neither ships nor
   enables one. See Residual #4 for what it covers and what it does not.
5. **Audit/observability** — evidence (`governance-preflight` audit log).
6. **PR / CI review** — the human release boundary.

## The hooks (what each enforces)

| Hook | Matcher | Enforces |
|---|---|---|
| `subagent-git-guard.sh` | PreToolUse·Bash | Denies MUTATING git from a subagent (`agent_id` present). Explicitly allowlisted read-only git (status/log/diff/show/listing/…) is permitted; everything else — including `fetch`, code-executing globals like `-c core.fsmonitor=<cmd>`, and any command substitution — is denied. `gh` stays categorically denied. |
| `git-safety-gate.sh` | PreToolUse·Bash | Main-agent git mutations → `ask`. |
| `protect-governance-files.sh` | PreToolUse·Write/Edit + Bash | Edits to the governance surface (`.claude/hooks/`, `settings.json`, `constitution.md`, `governance.conf`, the verdict lib + `policy.sh`, `loom-governance/hooks/`) → subagent `deny` / main `ask`. Stops the model softening its own rules. That set is a **fixed floor**; `governance.conf`'s `protected_paths` key can only ADD to it — see *Protected-path floor* below. |
| `guard-dangerous-commands.sh` | PreToolUse·Bash | Policy-based dangerous-command blocking (enforces on bash 3.2+, i.e. stock macOS; prefers bash 4 when present — see *bash<4 fail-open is CLOSED* below). |
| `freeze-write-scope.sh` | PreToolUse·Write/Edit | Plan-as-DAG file-ownership; paths canonicalized (`realpath`) so `..`/symlink/`//` cannot escape the `owns:` scope. |
| `governance-preflight.sh` | UserPromptSubmit | Domain briefs + memory; strict-mode recitation. |

## Detection model

A subagent's tool call carries an `agent_id` (and `agent_type`) in the
PreToolUse payload; the main agent's does not. This is the basis for
"subagent → deny, main → ask" and is **empirically verified** (not documented
contract) — re-verify if a future Claude Code version changes the field.

## The subagent git guarantee (what it is, precisely)

**The guarantee is "a subagent never MUTATES git" — not "a subagent never
touches git".** It was the latter until §7.3; the blanket deny also blocked
`git status`, which bought no safety and blocked legitimate read-only worker
exploration.

The rule is an **ALLOWLIST of known-safe reads, then deny everything else**
(`loom_git_is_readonly_for_subagent` in `.logic-loom/lib/governance-verdicts.sh`).
It is deliberately NOT "classify mutations and allow the remainder", and must not
be refactored into one: with a mutation-classifier the failure mode is a false
NEGATIVE — a silent subagent mutation, the exact thing Principle VI exists to
prevent. With an allowlist the failure mode is a false POSITIVE — a worker is
loudly denied some read, someone notices, and it is fixed in a day.

A subagent git invocation is allowed only when **all** of these hold:

1. the subcommand is on the explicit read-only allowlist (`status`, `log`,
   `diff`, `show`, `rev-parse`, `rev-list`, `ls-files`, `ls-tree`,
   `cat-file`, `describe`, `blame`, `shortlog`, `whatchanged`, `grep`,
   `merge-base`, `name-rev`, `count-objects`, `verify-commit`, `verify-tag`,
   `check-ignore`, `check-attr`, `diff-tree`, `diff-index`, `for-each-ref`,
   `show-ref`);
2. for a subcommand with both read and write forms, the args are the read form —
   `branch` listing only, `tag -l`-style listing only, `stash list|show`,
   `remote` bare/`-v`/`show`/`get-url`, `worktree list`, `config
   --get|--get-all|--get-regexp|--list`, `reflog show`, `notes list|show`,
   `bisect log|view`, `symbolic-ref` with at most one operand;
3. no git global flag outside a short safe list (`-C <path>`, `--no-pager`,
   `-P`/`--paginate`, the pathspec-mode flags, `--no-optional-locks`). In
   particular `-c` / `--config-env` / `--exec-path` / `--git-dir` / `--work-tree`
   / `--namespace` are denied — `git -c core.fsmonitor=<cmd> status` *executes*
   `<cmd>`, and the dir/tree flags point git at a different repository;
4. **no environment assignment precedes the `git` word** — see "Closed vector:
   environment assignment" below;
5. no argument anywhere in the invocation is on the denied-argument list
   (`--output`, `--ext-diff`, `--textconv`, `--contents`, `--upload-pack`,
   `--receive-pack`, `--open-files-in-pager`, `--exec-path`, `--git-dir`,
   `--work-tree`, `--namespace`, `--config-env`, `--attr-source`,
   `--super-prefix`, and any short-flag cluster containing `-O`). These are the
   post-subcommand equivalents of the rule-3 globals: `git log --output=/tmp/f`
   writes a file, `git diff --ext-diff` runs the configured external diff
   program, `git blame --contents /etc/passwd` reads outside the repo, and
   `git grep -O <cmd>` executes `<cmd>`. Matched on the token's name half, so
   both `--flag=value` and `--flag value` are caught;
6. the command line contains no command or process substitution (`$(…)`,
   backticks, `<(…)`), checked against the raw command before segment splitting.

**Removed from the allowlist** (upstream cross-provider review): `ls-remote` —
unattended network I/O from a worker, and an execution primitive when paired with
a hostile `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`/`--upload-pack`; and `submodule status|summary` —
both dispatch `git-submodule--helper` and re-enter git inside each submodule, so
the args the gate validated are not the args that ultimately run.

**Closed vector: environment assignment.** `_loom_cmd_after_prefix` skips
`VAR=value` as a harmless prefix so that `env FOO=1 git push` is still recognized
as git. On the subagent *read* path that was a full bypass of rules 3 and 5 —
git's environment achieves everything the denied flags achieve without ever
looking like a flag: `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF` / `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` / `GIT_PAGER` /
`GIT_EDITOR` make git **execute** a named program; `GIT_DIR` / `GIT_WORK_TREE` /
`GIT_CONFIG*` / `GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES` **redirect the repository**;
`LD_PRELOAD` / `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` / `PATH` / `IFS` / `BASH_ENV` hijack the
process. The gate now denies **any** leading assignment on the subagent read
path, including via `env` — categorical rather than a `GIT_*`-plus-known-bad
enumeration, because an enumeration is one new git environment variable away
from a silent hole and a worker running read-only git has no legitimate reason
to set a variable inline. Main-agent verdicts are unchanged.

`fetch` is denied for subagents (it writes remote-tracking refs and touches the
network). `gh` remains **categorically** denied for subagents, reads included —
unchanged. Main-agent behavior is unchanged in every respect.

The inline fallback in `subagent-git-guard.sh` (used only when the verdict lib is
missing) stays **categorical**: it denies all subagent git, reads included. It
deliberately does not re-implement the allowlist.

## Residual bypass surface (KNOWN — not closed)

These are inherent to string-level gating over a shell. They are documented, not
hidden; close them with the defense-in-depth stack above, not by trusting hooks.

1. **Interpreter / eval indirection.** `python -c "subprocess git…"`,
   `bash some-script.sh` (git/write inside the script), `eval "$cmd"`, variable
   indirection (`G=git; $G push`) are invisible to a string gate. Out of scope by
   design for all Bash hooks.
2. **Bash write-path escape of the freeze DAG.** `freeze-write-scope` gates the
   `Write`/`Edit` tools. A worker can still write *outside its `owns:` scope* via
   Bash redirects (`cat > f`, `tee`, heredoc, `dd of=`). **Mitigation today:**
   `protect-governance-files` *does* cover Bash mutations for the protected
   governance paths specifically; and the freeze DAG is only active during
   `/swarm implement`. **Not yet closed** for arbitrary DAG-owned paths — a
   focused follow-up (extend freeze to a Bash matcher + redirect-target parsing).
3. **Silent hook failure.** A non-zero hook exit does not always block a tool
   call (esp. batched calls). Hooks here fail *open* on infra gaps deliberately
   (never block on a broken policy lib); that is a safety/availability trade.
4. **Execution isolation is the host's, it is opt-in, and LogicLoom ships none
   of its own.** The earlier wording here — "no execution sandbox" — was wrong in
   the same way an overclaim is wrong, just pointing the other direction: it
   asserted an absence that is not real. Corrected 2026-08-24 (LOOM-0031).

   **What exists (official docs + verified in use).** Claude Code ships a
   built-in Bash sandbox: macOS Seatbelt (`/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`), Linux/WSL2
   bubblewrap + socat with an optional seccomp filter. When on, it restricts
   *writes* to the working directory plus the session `$TMPDIR`, restricts
   *network egress* to an allowlist enforced by a local proxy, and can unset or
   mask credential env vars and deny reads of credential files. Subagents inherit
   the parent session's sandbox configuration.

   **What it is NOT (this is the part that keeps the residual real).**
   - **Opt-in, not the standing posture.** It is keyed on `sandbox.enabled`,
     which defaults off. *Verified in use:* neither `~/.claude/settings.json` nor
     this repo's `.claude/settings.json` sets a `sandbox` key, and a probe from
     inside a session wrote to `$HOME` and `/tmp`, saw an unmodified `$TMPDIR`,
     and reached an unallowlisted host — i.e. no sandbox was in force. The
     presence of the Bash tool's `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` parameter is **not**
     evidence that isolation is on; the parameter sits in the static tool schema
     regardless, and is inert when the sandbox is disabled or when
     `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`.
   - **Bash-only.** Official docs, § *Scope*: "The sandbox isolates Bash
     subprocesses." `Read`, `Edit`, and `Write` go through the permission system
     instead — so an agent writing to an allowed path, or to *any* path via the
     file tools, is not a sandbox question at all. That is exactly the gap
     `freeze-write-scope` covers, and exactly why residual #2 (Bash write-path
     escape of the freeze DAG) is not closed by turning the sandbox on.
   - **Reads are wide open by default.** The default read policy allows the whole
     machine minus a denied set; `~/.ssh` and `~/.aws/credentials` are readable
     unless `sandbox.credentials` or `denyRead` is configured.
   - **Fails open.** If the sandbox cannot start (missing dependency,
     unsupported platform — native Windows is unsupported), the default is a
     warning and unsandboxed execution, unless `sandbox.failIfUnavailable` is
     set. Same trade as residual #3, one layer down.
   - **The model can leave it.** On a sandbox-caused failure Claude may retry
     with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`; the retry drops to the normal
     permission flow rather than to nothing, but the boundary is per-call and
     model-initiated unless `allowUnsandboxedCommands` is `false`.
   - **Anthropic grades it porous itself.** Documented limitations include
     domain-fronting past a proxy that allowlists on the client-supplied
     hostname without TLS inspection, Unix-socket escalation (`docker.sock`),
     `allowWrite` paths on `$PATH` or over shell rc files, `allowAppleEvents`
     removing code-execution isolation on macOS, and env vars inherited into
     sandboxed commands including credentials.

   **Where the two boundaries meet.** They are orthogonal, not stacked. The host
   sandbox bounds *what a Bash subprocess can touch* and is blind to intent;
   LogicLoom's hooks bound *which operations an agent may request* (git
   mutations, the governance surface, DAG-owned paths) and are blind to what a
   subprocess actually does once launched — residual #1. Each covers the other's
   blind spot only partially: the sandbox would catch a `python -c` git write
   *outside the allowed tree*, but not one inside the working directory, which is
   where every interesting repo mutation lives. Turning the sandbox on therefore
   narrows residuals #1 and #2 at the edges and closes neither.

   **What genuinely remains.** LogicLoom does not enable, require, configure, or
   verify the host sandbox; nothing in `.claude/settings.json`, no hook, and no
   preflight reads `sandbox.*`. So the harness's shipped posture is unsandboxed
   by default, and the honest floor statement is unchanged: hooks are a porous
   floor, and the isolation layer beneath them is a host feature the operator has
   to switch on. `worktree-port-namespace` remains *collision avoidance*, not
   isolation, and contributes nothing here. Under Pillar 2 the open work is to
   **evaluate and surface** the native boundary — a documented, opt-in
   `sandbox.enabled` posture for this repo, with the Bash-only and fail-open
   caveats stated — not to build a container/VM layer of our own. Revisit the
   priority if auto-approval is ever enabled: `autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` defaults
   to `true`, so enabling the sandbox and enabling auto-approval are the same
   decision unless it is explicitly set to `false`.
5. **Cross-check CLI mode trusts the provider sandbox, not our hooks.** The
   `cross-check` skill's opt-in Mode B (`--deep`) shells an external provider CLI
   (`codex exec --sandbox read-only -c approval_policy='"never"' …`) so a non-Claude
   model can explore the repo read-only. That CLI runs as a **subprocess** — the
   same blind spot as residual #1 — so its read-only-ness is enforced by the
   *provider's* `--sandbox read-only` flag, NOT by LogicLoom's Bash hooks.
   **Mitigations:** Mode A (API, artifact-scoped, no agentic surface) is the
   default and has no such assumption; Mode B is opt-in and the skill forbids
   invoking the provider CLI in any write-capable sandbox
   (`workspace-write`/`danger-full-access`); the external model is advisory-only
   regardless of mode (it returns findings, never edits). Acceptable for an
   advisory read-only adversary; revisit if the provider CLI is ever granted
   write or auto-approval from this slot.
7. **A degraded parse is now restrictive about the target, but a WRONGLY-EXTRACTED
   value is still trusted (LOOM-0044, partial).** With neither `jq` nor `python3`
   on PATH the hooks read their JSON payload with `grep`. Two fixes have landed
   and they cover different halves:
   - LOOM-0043 made an empty `agent_id` mean "cannot tell" rather than "main
     agent", so a subagent cannot pass as the main agent. That covers **who**.
   - LOOM-0044 stopped an empty `file_path` / `command` / target extraction from
     reaching an explicit `allow`: a subagent is denied and the main agent is
     asked, because "I cannot read what this touches" must not authorize it. That
     covers **what**, but **only the empty case**.

   **What remains, stated plainly.** The `grep` rung keys on the LAST dot-segment
   of a field path, so `.tool_input.command` also matches a nested `.foo.command`
   elsewhere in the payload. A wrongly-extracted **non-empty** value is still
   taken at face value, and is now arguably more dangerous than before, because
   the empty case being handled makes the extraction look more trustworthy than
   it is. An external adversarial review (Codex, 2026-09-02) made exactly this
   point and it is not fixed here.

   Closing it properly means not making security decisions from `grep` at all —
   treating "no structured parser" as a hook-health failure with a named
   remediation rather than an input to policy. That is a larger change with real
   lockout risk on a host lacking both parsers, so it is filed as **LOOM-0058**
   rather than smuggled in here. The adopt README already states `jq` or
   `python3` is a session-time requirement, which is the ground that change would
   stand on.

   The anti-lockout property of what DID land is regression-tested: on a degraded
   host a readable, harmless command still resolves to `allow`, so only genuinely
   unreadable payloads escalate.

8. **The governance-file Bash guard is a token matcher, and these forms still
   pass it (LOOM-0059 / LOOM-0069, partially closed 2026-09-08).** The guard was
   substring-matching raw command text; it now resolves candidate path tokens
   lexically, tracks a `cd`/`pushd` prefix across segments, unwraps `sh -c`
   indirection, and recognises a wider mutator set. A 253-row contract test
   (`test_governance_hooks.sh`) pins 12 verbs x 6 path spellings x 2 agent kinds.

   **What still passes, verified by probe on 2026-09-08 — do not read the test's
   253/253 as "closed":**
   - `eval "rm .claude/settings.json"` — eval is not unwrapped.
   - `python3 -c "open('.claude/settings.json','w')"` — interpreter indirection,
     the long-standing residual #1.
   - `D=.claude; rm $D/settings.json` — no variable expansion.
   - `xargs rm < list.txt` — the target is in a file, not the command.
   - `find .claude -name settings.json -delete` — the protected path never
     appears as a single token; catching it requires understanding `find`.
   - `rm -f 'fix;note' .claude/settings.json` — the segment splitter is not
     quote-aware, so a `;` inside quotes shears the path into a segment whose
     command word is not a mutator. Confirmed present WITH AND WITHOUT the
     `sh -c` unwrap, so it is the splitter (the LOOM-0058 class), not the unwrap.

   **A known false POSITIVE, accepted deliberately:** `cp .claude/settings.json
   /tmp/backup.json` is gated even though it only READS the protected file. The
   mutator list keys on the command word, not on which operand is the target.
   This is the direction the design chooses on purpose — a loud false positive
   over a silent false negative.

   **Why this list is not simply worked through.** Every entry above is another
   case in a list, and two independent external reviews (Codex and Antigravity,
   2026-09-02 and 09-08) reached the same conclusion the git tokenizer work
   reached in LOOM-0044 and LOOM-0058: a shell-parsing gate cannot be completed
   by adding cases. Closing this class means enforcing on resolved paths rather
   than parsing command strings — recorded as **LOOM-0071**, and a maintainer
   decision because it is a rewrite of the floor.

6. **The subagent read-only git allowlist is still a string gate (new in §7.3).**
   Two honest consequences of replacing the blanket subagent-git deny with an
   allowlist:
   - **Indirection is unchanged but now matters more.** Residual #1 already meant
     a subagent could reach git through `bash script.sh` / `eval` / `$G push`.
     That was true before §7.3 too — the blanket deny never saw those either — so
     this is not a new hole, but the surface is worth naming again: the allowlist
     grants nothing to an indirect invocation, and blocks nothing there either.
   - **A mis-parsed read form is now a possible false-ALLOW.** Before §7.3 a
     parsing bug in the git argument scanner could only cost a false deny. Now a
     write form that the scanner mis-reads as a read form would be *allowed* —
     bounded to the read/write subcommands listed above (`branch`, `tag`,
     `stash`, `remote`, `worktree`, `config`, `reflog`, `notes`, `bisect`,
     `symbolic-ref`), since every other subcommand must appear
     verbatim on the allowlist to pass at all. The blast radius therefore
     excludes `push`/`commit`/`reset`/`clean`/`checkout`/`rebase`/`merge`, which
     can never be reached by an arg-parsing mistake. **Mitigations:** the
     allowlist shape (unknown ⇒ deny), the golden fixtures in
     `tests/contract/test_governance_verdicts.sh`, the categorical fallback in
     the hook, and the unchanged main-agent approval gate on the same operations.
   - **ACCEPTED RESIDUAL — the policy boundary is a raw string, not argv.** The
     gate splits and tokenizes the command *text* with shell-parameter
     expansion; it never sees the argv the kernel will actually receive. So
     quoting, backslash escapes, `$IFS` games, and glob expansion can in
     principle separate what the gate reads from what git runs (e.g. a quoted
     `"--out""put=/tmp/f"`, or a pathspec that a later expansion turns into a
     flag). The cross-provider review recommended moving the boundary to
     tokenized argv, or rejecting every shell metacharacter outright.
     **Decision: not now — accepted, not closed.** Both options are a redesign of
     the gate rather than a hardening of it: real argv requires intercepting at a
     different layer than PreToolUse text, and a blanket metacharacter rejection
     would deny most legitimate worker reads (quoted `--grep` patterns, globs,
     `--` pathspecs) and push workers toward `bash -c`, i.e. residual #1, which
     is strictly worse. This is the same "floor, not sandbox" trade the rest of
     this document documents. **Mitigations:** command/process substitution is
     already rejected against the raw string; unknown ⇒ deny bounds the blast
     radius as above; the main-agent approval gate is unchanged. **Revisit if:**
     a structured-argv PreToolUse payload becomes available from the host, or
     subagent auto-approval is ever enabled.

## Bottom line

Governance is a real, model-independent **floor** — it makes the common,
high-impact failures (autonomous git, a subagent's `git clean`, the model
rewriting its own hooks, writing outside an owned scope) *hard*. It is not a
jail. Market it as defense-in-depth; keep the residuals above documented and
revisited.

## Provider portability (policy travels; enforcement does not)

LogicLoom is being made **provider-portable at the policy layer**. The honest
through-line: **policy** travels to any host as model-followed rules;
**enforcement** is host-specific and **binary present/absent** — a host either
has a conformant adapter or it degrades to followed-trust; **tooling/diagnostics**
run anywhere with a shell but VALIDATE, they do not ENFORCE.

**L1 — provider-neutral POLICY (travels to any host, model-followed).** The
constitution (16 principles as prose), AGENTS.md Tier 1 (operating principles +
the Cross-Check Disposition + neutral capability catalog + the in-band
"Enforcement reality" banner), the cross-check advisory/read-only contract, and
the `models.conf` role→tier *convention* (read as "most-capable / cheaper-faster").
Off Claude Code this is the ONLY layer left, and it is **unenforced**.

**L2 — host ENFORCEMENT ADAPTERS (host-specific; Claude Code = reference).** Four
guarantees need real enforcement: (VI) git-mutation approval gate, (VI)
subagent-git-mutation-deny, (governance) governance-file self-protection, (DAG)
freeze-write-scope. Today each is a Claude Code `PreToolUse` script emitting
`permissionDecision` JSON wired only in `.claude/settings.json` — invisible to
every other host. The portable move factors each guarantee's **decision logic**
into a pure-bash **verdict function** (`is-mutating-git?`, `is-protected-path?`,
`is-outside-owns?`) returning `allow|ask|deny`; the thin Claude Code JSON wrapper
is the reference adapter. Other hosts implement their own adapter (a repo git
pre-push/pre-commit hook; a PATH `git` wrapper that refuses non-interactive git
as the subagent-deny substitute, since `agent_id` is a Claude-internal signal no
other host emits; a CI gate; or the host's native pre-tool-use hook) **calling
the same verdict functions**.

**L3 — host-agnostic TOOLING / DIAGNOSTICS (runs anywhere; VALIDATES, not
ENFORCES).** `constitutional-check.sh` (a validator — it reports compliance, it
does not gate it), the plugin command `.md` procedures (plain-English readable on
any host; only the generated `/slash` UX + frontmatter `model:` keyword are
Claude-only), the cross-check API/CLI calls the SKILL.md procedure makes, and the
`common.sh`/`load-context.sh` helpers. Pure bash, any shell — but **diagnostics,
not portable governance**. Note: cross-check ships as `SKILL.md` (a
model-executed procedure), NOT a standalone entrypoint — a foreign agent cannot
"shell out to the cross-check script"; it re-creates the curl/CLI calls from the
procedure.

### Honest enforced-vs-followed matrix

| Host         | L1 policy | git-gate (VI)    | subagent-mut-deny   | gov-file protect | freeze-scope (DAG) |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Claude Code  | followed  | ENFORCED (hook)  | ENFORCED (agent_id) | ENFORCED (hook)  | ENFORCED (hook)    |
| Codex CLI    | followed  | adapter†         | followed            | followed-only\*  | followed-only\*    |
| Cursor       | followed  | adapter†         | followed            | followed-only\*  | followed-only\*    |
| Gemini CLI   | followed  | adapter†         | followed            | followed-only\*  | followed-only\*    |
| Copilot      | followed  | adapter†         | followed            | followed-only\*  | followed-only\*    |
| Aider        | followed  | adapter† (git-hook) | followed (no subagents) | followed-only\* | followed-only\* |

\* the host HAS a pre-tool-use mechanism that COULD host an adapter, but **no
conformant adapter ships today**, so the cell is "followed-only" until one passes
the golden fixture. `subagent-mut-deny` is "followed" everywhere but Claude Code
because `agent_id` is a Claude-internal signal no other host emits.

**Project mandates (`amendments.md`) are `followed` in every column, by
decision — including Claude Code.** They deliberately have no row above, because
a mandate is not an enforcement surface on any host: nothing loads
`.logic-loom/memory/amendments.md`, nothing validates a mandate, nothing fails
closed, and no floor hook consults one. Wiring it into `governance-preflight.sh`
was **considered and declined (2026-08-24)** — this is a settled position, not a
missing adapter, and it should not be read as a gap awaiting Phase 3. The reason
is the same one that produced the fail-open rule elsewhere in this document: a
loader would raise the *appearance* of enforcement without moving a single
verdict, since the hook floor would still never consult a mandate. That is a
phantom gate. A fork gets a file upstream never overwrites, a mandate grammar,
and reader-adjudicated composition rules; it does not get injection, validation,
warning, or any change to `deny`/`ask`/`allow`. See
`.logic-loom/memory/constitution.md` § *Project Amendments* → *What this
mechanism is not: there is no loader*.

**Blunt truth.** Governance does NOT "degrade gracefully" onto other hosts —
enforcement is **binary present/absent by host**. Off Claude Code it is the
model-followed policy plus whatever conformant adapter someone writes. What is
portable is the POLICY and the Cross-Check Disposition, not the enforcement
floor. This is a **considered supersession** of the prior absolute "not
provider-portable" stance (recorded in CHANGELOG + project memory), mirroring the
v6.1/v6.2 supersession-note pattern.

> **Status of L2 adapters.** The adapter *contract* (verdict functions +
> golden-fixture conformance gate) is defined here. **Shipped (Phase 1–2):**
> (1) the verdict-function refactor — `.logic-loom/lib/governance-verdicts.sh`,
> the single source the four Claude Code hooks now call (golden fixtures:
> `tests/contract/test_governance_verdicts.sh`, 36/36); and (2) the first
> reference NON-Claude adapter — the off-host **git-approval gate**
> (`.logic-loom/adapters/`: a `pre-push` hook + a PATH `git` wrapper) which calls
> those same verdicts and passes `tests/contract/test_git_adapter.sh` (18/18).
> So the **git-gate (VI)** guarantee is now *conformance-enforced on any
> POSIX-shell host that installs the adapter* (`bash .logic-loom/adapters/install.sh`),
> marked `adapter†` in the matrix — subject to the inherent client-side bypasses
> documented in `.logic-loom/adapters/README.md` → *Honest limits* (absolute-path
> `git`, `git push --no-verify`, the honor-system `LOOM_GIT_APPROVED` token). The
> **governance-file protection** and **freeze-write-scope** adapters are NOT yet

> - **The built-in floor cannot be removed.** `protected_paths` in
>   `governance.conf` may only ADD paths. There is no removal, override, reset, or
>   negation syntax — the parser appends and nothing else, so no config file can
>   express a removal. The floor is checked FIRST and never consults config.
> - **Why it must be one-directional.** The protected set contains
>   `governance.conf` itself and the verdict lib. A REPLACEABLE set would let a
>   fork — or the model — drop those two entries and then rewrite every hook, the
>   constitution, and the lib unopposed. That is privilege escalation dressed as
>   portability. Additive-only bounds the worst case to protecting *too much*:
>   loud, obvious, and undone by deleting a line.
> - **Fail-safe, never fail-open.** Missing, unreadable, or malformed config
>   leaves the floor standing alone; invalid entries are skipped individually. No
>   code path lets a config problem reduce protection.
> - **Entries are literals, not globs.** Matching uses a QUOTED `case` pattern, so
>   `*`/`?`/`[`/`]`/`\` are never interpreted; entries containing them (beyond an
>   optional trailing `/*`, which is spelling for "and everything beneath"),
>   absolute paths, `~`, and `..` segments are ignored. A literal cannot be
>   crafted to match less than it appears to.
> - **Renames self-protect.** Half the floor is derived from the verdict lib's own
>   file location, so a fork using `.specify/` gets its `lib/`,
>   `config/governance.conf`, and `memory/constitution.md` protected with zero
>   configuration; `protected_paths` covers whatever else it moved.
> - **Enforced status is unchanged.** This widens *what* is protected and *who can
>   widen it*; it does not change the `deny`/`ask`/`allow` verdicts or the matrix
>   cells. The invariant is pinned by fixtures in
>   `tests/contract/test_governance_verdicts.sh` (floor holds with no config, an
>   empty key, every removal attempt the syntax permits, and a malformed file).
>
> **Floor-integrity hardening (post-gate-review).** Because the verdict lib is now
> load-bearing, it is itself in the protected set (`loom_path_is_protected` covers
