## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-11

### Major Feature: DS-STAR Multi-Agent Enhancement (Feature 001)

This release integrates Google's proven DS-STAR multi-agent patterns into the SDD framework, bringing sophisticated quality gates, intelligent routing, and self-healing capabilities.

#### Added - DS-STAR Agent Library

- **VerificationAgent** (`src/sdd/agents/quality/verifier.py`)
  - Binary quality decisions (sufficient/insufficient) at each workflow stage
  - Specification completeness validation (≥0.90 threshold)
  - Plan quality validation (≥0.85 threshold, ≥0.90 spec alignment)
  - Blocks progression when quality insufficient
  - Provides actionable feedback for improvements

- **FinalizerAgent** (`src/sdd/agents/quality/finalizer.py`)
  - Pre-commit constitutional compliance validation
  - All 14 constitutional principles validation
  - Test coverage verification (≥80%)
  - Code style compliance (black, isort)
  - Documentation synchronization checks
  - No automatic git operations (Principle VI compliant)

- **RouterAgent** (`src/sdd/agents/architecture/router.py`)
  - Intelligent multi-agent task orchestration
  - Domain detection and agent selection
  - Dependency graph (DAG) execution planning
  - Parallel execution optimization
  - Routing decision audit trails

- **AutoDebugAgent** (`src/sdd/agents/engineering/autodebug.py`)
  - Automatic error repair with >70% fix rate target
  - <30 second debug iteration cycles
  - Common error pattern recognition
  - Self-healing code corrections

- **ContextAnalyzerAgent** (`src/sdd/agents/architecture/context_analyzer.py`)
  - Semantic codebase search with <2 second retrieval
  - Context intelligence and summarization
  - Codebase understanding for agent tasks

#### Added - Refinement Engine

- **Iterative Refinement Loop** (`src/sdd/refinement/engine.py`)
  - Up to 20 refinement rounds with configurable thresholds
  - Early stopping at 0.95 quality threshold
  - State persistence between iterations
  - Feedback accumulation across rounds
  - Graceful escalation to human when needed

- **Configuration System** (`.specify/config/refinement.conf`)
  - `MAX_REFINEMENT_ROUNDS=20` - Maximum iteration limit
  - `EARLY_STOP_THRESHOLD=0.95` - High quality early exit
  - `SPEC_COMPLETENESS_THRESHOLD=0.90` - Specification requirement
  - `PLAN_QUALITY_THRESHOLD=0.85` - Plan requirement
  - `TEST_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=0.80` - Code coverage requirement

#### Enhanced - Workflow Commands

- **`/specify` Command**
  - Automatic refinement loop after spec generation
  - Iterative improvement until quality threshold met
  - Actionable feedback for specification improvements
  - Human escalation when quality unachievable

- **`/plan` Command**
  - Automatic verification gate after plan generation
  - Quality blocking before task generation phase
  - Plan-to-spec alignment validation
  - Actionable feedback for plan improvements

- **`/finalize` Command** (NEW)
  - Pre-commit compliance validation
  - All 14 constitutional principles checked
  - Test and coverage verification
  - Code style and linting validation
  - Documentation synchronization checks
  - Manual git command suggestions (no auto-execution)

#### Added - Testing Infrastructure

- **Contract Tests** (39 tests, 100% pass rate)
  - VerificationAgent contract tests (13 tests)
  - FinalizerAgent contract tests (13 tests)
  - RouterAgent contract tests (13 tests)
  - Full interface validation coverage

- **Integration Tests** (37 tests)
  - End-to-end verification workflow tests
  - Multi-agent routing orchestration tests
  - Context intelligence tests
  - Refinement loop tests
  - Autodebug healing tests

#### Added - Documentation

- **Feature Specification** (`specs/001-ds-star-multi/`)
  - Complete DS-STAR implementation spec
  - Technical design documentation
  - API contracts and data models
  - Test scenarios and quickstart guide

- **Integration Guides**
  - DS-STAR integration guide
  - Implementation status tracking
  - Test results documentation
  - Production readiness report

#### Enhanced - Framework Features

- **Graceful Degradation**
  - Framework works without Python/DS-STAR components
  - Warning messages when components unavailable
  - Manual review recommendations
  - No workflow blocking

- **Performance Targets**
  - Context retrieval: <2 seconds
  - Debug iteration: <30 seconds
  - 3.5x task completion accuracy improvement (target)
  - >70% automatic fix rate (target)

### Changed

- Updated README.md with DS-STAR feature documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with DS-STAR workflow enhancements
- Enhanced directory structure with `src/sdd/` Python library
- Added `.docs/agents/shared/` for cross-agent state

### Breaking Changes

None - DS-STAR enhancements are fully backward compatible with graceful degradation.
