# Contract Tests: adopt-package payload boundary
#
# packaging/adopt/payload-manifest.txt is the reviewable PROPOSAL for which
# subset of the harness the npm adopt package installs into someone else's repo
# (research § 6 PRE-1). The installer is not written yet; this suite is the
# manifest's only consumer, and it exists so the boundary cannot drift or be
# edited into something harmful before the installer arrives.
#
# What it pins:
#   1. Grammar — every non-comment line carries a known verb.
#   2. The non-negotiable exclusion: .github/ and all five workflows. No
#      adopt-side path removes them, so nothing downstream removes
#      them, and branch-topology-guard.yml then fails every PR they open.
#   3. The other required exclusions: tests/, package.json, and the
#      template-clone onboarding files.
#   4. The required inclusions: the harness core.
#   5. Coherence — no path both included and excluded; every include/rename/
#      merge SOURCE exists in the tree, so a row cannot rot silently.
#   6. packaging/ never ships: it is a template-strip-manifest entry, and this
#      manifest excludes it too.
#   7. The PRE-12 Node-floor note survives, dated + sourced + re-checkable, still
#      naming the command that would confirm it.
#
# bash 3.2 safe: no associative arrays, no mapfile, no [[ -v ]], no ${var,,}.
