# START HERE - SDD Agentic Framework Setup

**One-command setup for Windows, macOS, and Linux**

This framework automatically installs all dependencies and guides you through project initialization. No technical experience required!

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Choose Your Platform)

### Windows (PowerShell or CMD)

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to the framework directory
cd path\to\sdd-agentic-framework

# Run automatic setup (installs everything for you)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .specify\scripts\setup-windows.ps1
```

**What this installs automatically:**
- Git for Windows (includes Git Bash)
- Node.js v20 LTS (includes npm)
- Claude Code CLI (with guidance)
- Framework dependencies
- Project configuration

---

### macOS (Terminal)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
# Navigate to the framework directory
cd path/to/sdd-agentic-framework

# Run automatic setup (installs everything for you)
bash .specify/scripts/setup.sh
```

**What this installs automatically:**
- Node.js (via Homebrew if available)
- Git (if not already installed)
- Claude Code CLI (with guidance)
- Framework dependencies
- Project configuration

---

### Linux (Terminal)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
# Navigate to the framework directory
cd path/to/sdd-agentic-framework

# Run automatic setup (installs everything for you)
bash .specify/scripts/setup.sh
```

**What this installs automatically:**
- Node.js (via apt/yum/dnf)
- Git (if not already installed)
- Claude Code CLI (with guidance)
- Framework dependencies
- Project configuration

---

## ✅ That's It!

The setup script will:
1. ✅ Detect your operating system
2. ✅ Check for required software (Node.js, Git, Claude Code)
3. ✅ Install missing dependencies automatically
4. ✅ Set up the framework
5. ✅ Guide you through creating your first PRD
6. ✅ Offer to launch Claude Code for you

**No manual installation required!**

---

## 🎯 After Setup: Your First Steps

Once setup completes, you'll be guided through:

### Step 1: Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

The setup will recommend creating a PRD first. This serves as your Single Source of Truth (SSOT).

```bash
# Claude Code will open automatically, then run:
/create-prd "Your Project Name"
```

### Step 2: Customize the Constitution

Edit `.specify/memory/constitution.md` using guidance from your PRD to customize all 14 principles for your project.

### Step 3: Create Specialized Agents (Optional)

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/create-agent "agent-name" "Description of what this agent does"
```

### Step 4: Start Feature Development

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/specify "feature name"  # Create specification
/plan                    # Generate implementation plan
/tasks                   # Create task list
```

   - Restart PowerShell

3. **Install Claude Code**
   - Visit [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
   - Follow Windows installation instructions
   - Run `claude login` in PowerShell

4. **Run Framework Setup**
   ```powershell

npm run setup:macos

# Linux
npm run setup:linux

# Auto-detect (may not work on Windows)
npm run setup
```

## 🤖 What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is your AI development assistant for this framework. It:
- Guides you through setup and configuration
- Helps troubleshoot any errors
- Executes framework commands (`/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/create-prd`)
- Assists with feature development
- Answers questions about the framework

**Think of Claude Code as your co-pilot throughout development.**

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Setup Script Won't Run

**Windows:**
- Make sure you're in PowerShell or CMD (not Git Bash for the initial setup)
- Try running PowerShell as Administrator
- Check the full command:
  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .specify\scripts\setup-windows.ps1
  ```

**macOS/Linux:**
- Make sure the script is executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x .specify/scripts/setup.sh
  bash .specify/scripts/setup.sh
  ```

### Line Ending Errors (CRLF Issues)

**Symptoms:**
```bash
bash: $'\r': command not found
syntax error near unexpected token `$'\r''
cannot execute: required file not found
```

**Cause:** Scripts have Windows line endings (CRLF) instead of Unix line endings (LF)

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Run the emergency line ending fixer
bash fix-line-endings.sh
```

**Manual Fix:**
```bash
# Remove carriage returns from all scripts
find .specify/scripts -name "*.sh" -type f -exec sed -i 's/\r$//' {} \;

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x .specify/scripts/*.sh
chmod +x .specify/scripts/bash/*.sh

# Try setup again
bash .specify/scripts/setup.sh
```

**Why this happens:**
- Git on Windows may checkout files with CRLF line endings
- Running the scripts in WSL/Git Bash requires LF endings
- The framework now includes `.gitattributes` to prevent this

### PowerShell Parse Errors

**Symptoms:**
```powershell
Unexpected token 'Path","User")
Missing expression after unary operator '--'
```

**Cause:** Character encoding issues or corrupted script

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Re-clone the repository
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/kelleysd-apps/sdd-agentic-framework.git
cd sdd-agentic-framework

# Try setup again
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .specify\scripts\setup-windows.ps1
```

### Downloads Fail

- Check your internet connection
- Try downloading manually from:
  - Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
  - Git: https://git-scm.com/
  - Claude Code: https://claude.ai/code

### Claude Code Won't Install

Claude Code installation may require manual steps:
1. Visit https://claude.ai/code
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Follow platform-specific installation instructions
4. Run `claude login` after installation
5. Re-run the setup script

### Still Stuck?

Once Claude Code is installed, open it and ask:
```
"I'm having trouble setting up the SDD framework. Here's the error I'm getting: [paste error]"
```

Claude Code has full context of the framework and can help troubleshoot!
