description: Create or update the feature specification from a natural language feature description.

**AGENT REQUIREMENT**: This command should be executed by the specification-agent.

**If you are NOT the specification-agent**, delegate this work immediately:
```
Use the Task tool to invoke specification-agent:
- subagent_type: "specification-agent"
- description: "Execute /specify command"
- prompt: "Execute the /specify command for this feature. Arguments: $ARGUMENTS"
```

The specification-agent is specialized for:
- Spec-Driven Development methodology
- Requirements analysis and user story creation
- Functional specifications and acceptance criteria
- Constitutional compliance validation
- Specification quality assurance

## Execution Instructions (for specification-agent)

Given the feature description provided as an argument, do this:

1. Check if user wants to create a new branch:
   - Ask user: "Would you like to create a new feature branch, or work on the current branch?"
   - If new branch requested: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS"`
   - If current branch: Use current branch and create spec file at `specs/[current-branch]/spec.md`
2. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.
3. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.
4. Run domain detection: `.specify/scripts/bash/detect-phase-domain.sh --file SPEC_FILE`
   - Identify which domains/agents will be involved based on keywords
   - Report suggested agents for this feature
5. Validate specification: `.specify/scripts/bash/validate-spec.sh --file SPEC_FILE`
   - Check for completeness and quality
   - Report validation score and any recommendations
6. Report completion with:
   - Branch name
   - Spec file path
   - Suggested agents for implementation
   - Validation score
   - Readiness for the next phase (/plan)

**Note**: Branch creation and any Git operations require explicit user approval (Constitutional Principle VI).
