# Agent Governance & Constitutional Compliance

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Ratified**: 2025-01-17
**Authority**: Supersedes individual agent preferences, subordinate to constitution.md

## Hierarchical Authority

1. **Primary**: `/workspaces/ioun-ai/.specify/memory/constitution.md` (Supreme Authority)
2. **Secondary**: `/workspaces/ioun-ai/.specify/memory/agent-governance.md` (This Document)
3. **Tertiary**: Individual agent definitions and department policies

## Core Agent Principles

### I. Constitutional Inheritance
Every agent inherits ALL constitutional principles without exception. Agents cannot override or weaken constitutional requirements, only strengthen them within their domain.

### II. Git Operations Mandate
**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: No agent may perform Git operations without explicit user approval. This includes but is not limited to:
- Branch creation, switching, or deletion
- Commits, pushes, pulls, merges
- Any modification to repository state
- Tag creation or modification

Agents MUST:
1. Request explicit user permission before ANY Git operation
2. Ask for user preferences on branch naming/formatting
3. Confirm each Git command before execution
4. Never assume implicit permission from context

### III. Single Source of Truth
The constitution.md file is the ONLY source of truth for:
- Development principles
- Workflow requirements
- Quality gates
- Technology constraints

Agents must reference this path explicitly in their definitions.

### IV. Test-First Enforcement
All agents involved in code generation or modification MUST:
1. Write tests before implementation
2. Get user approval for test cases
3. Ensure tests fail before implementing
4. Maintain >80% code coverage standards

### V. Library-First Architecture
Engineering and architecture agents MUST enforce:
- Every feature starts as a standalone library
- No direct application code without library abstraction
- Clear boundaries and interfaces
- Reusability beyond immediate use case

## Agent Lifecycle Management

### Creation Standards
New agents must:
1. Be created through `create-agent.sh` tool
2. Include mandatory constitutional references
3. Define clear department classification
4. Specify restricted tool access
5. Initialize memory structure

### Update Protocol
When constitution.md is modified:
1. Automatic notification to all agents via update system
2. Validation run to ensure compliance
3. Regeneration of affected agent definitions
4. Audit log entry created

### Deprecation Process
1. Mark agent as deprecated with sunset date
2. Migrate responsibilities to other agents
3. Archive memory to historical storage
4. Remove from active registry after sunset

## Department Governance

### Architecture Agents
- Focus on design and planning
- Read-only access to code
- Cannot make implementation changes
- Must enforce constitutional architecture principles

### Engineering Agents
- Full development capabilities
- Must follow test-first approach
- Enforce code quality standards
- Cannot bypass review processes

### Quality Agents
- Testing and review focus
- Cannot modify production code
- Must maintain audit trails
- Enforce coverage requirements

### Data Agents
- Database and data pipeline scope
- Must validate all schema changes
- Enforce data governance policies
- Cannot bypass migration processes

### Product Agents
- Requirements and UX focus
- No code modification rights
- Must validate against user needs
- Cannot make technical decisions

### Operations Agents
- Deployment and monitoring scope
- Must follow release procedures
- Cannot bypass security checks
- Enforce operational standards

## Tool Access Governance

### Restriction Principles
1. Minimum necessary privilege
2. Department-appropriate access
3. No privilege escalation
4. Audit trail for sensitive operations

### Write Access Control
- Only Engineering agents have unrestricted Write
- Other departments require justification
- Temporary write access requires approval
- All writes must be logged

### Bash Execution Control
- Security scanning before execution
- No credential exposure
- Resource limits enforced
- Command logging mandatory

## Memory Management

### Memory Structure Requirements
```
.docs/agents/{department}/{agent}/
├── context/          # Current working context
├── knowledge/        # Accumulated knowledge
├── decisions/        # Decision history
└── performance/      # Metrics and optimization
```

### Memory Persistence Rules
1. No sensitive data in memory
2. Regular cleanup of stale data
3. Version control for important knowledge
4. Cross-agent memory sharing protocols

## Collaboration Protocols

### Agent-to-Agent Communication
- Through shared memory patterns only
- No direct agent invocation
- Audit trail for all interactions
- Clear handoff procedures

### Human-Agent Interaction
- User commands have ultimate authority
- Explicit approval for significant actions
- Clear explanation of agent actions
- Feedback incorporation mandatory

## Compliance Monitoring

### Automated Checks
- Daily: Constitutional reference validation
- Weekly: Tool access audit
- Monthly: Memory cleanup
- Quarterly: Performance review

### Manual Reviews
- Agent effectiveness assessment
- Department alignment check
- Tool usage optimization
- Memory efficiency review

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Violations Handling
1. **Minor**: Warning and correction
2. **Major**: Agent suspension pending fix
3. **Critical**: Immediate deactivation
4. **Systemic**: Policy review triggered

### Appeals Process
1. Document violation context
2. Propose remediation
3. Review by governance team
4. Decision and precedent setting

## Amendment Process

### Proposal Requirements
- Clear problem statement
- Proposed solution
- Impact analysis
- Migration plan

### Approval Process
1. Technical review
2. Constitutional alignment check
3. User impact assessment
4. Implementation timeline

### Implementation
1. Update this document
2. Update all agents
3. Validate compliance
4. Document changes

## Exceptions Framework

### Temporary Exceptions
- Maximum 30-day duration
- Requires written justification
- Must have remediation plan
- Regular review mandatory

### Permanent Exceptions
- Requires constitutional amendment
- Full impact analysis needed
- User approval required
- Documentation mandatory

## Audit Trail Requirements

All agent operations must maintain:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "agent": "agent-name",
  "department": "department",
  "action": "action-type",
  "user_approval": boolean,
  "details": {},
  "outcome": "success|failure"
}
```
