    # therefore made recall — and so whether any hit cleared

    # Two phases, because this runs inside a per-prompt UserPromptSubmit hook:
    #   Phase 1 — cheap discovery with `grep -rIl`, which EARLY-EXITS on a file's
    #     first match, and skips binary files (`-I`). A recursive `grep -c` would
    #     instead read every file end to end, and the >50KB skip used to sit in
    #     the loop BELOW the recursive grep, so it no longer protected the
    #     expensive step at all.
    #   Phase 2 — size-filter the candidate set FIRST, then count matching lines
    #     over the survivors only. The survivor set is small, so counting is
    #     bounded and no oversized file is ever read end to end.

    # literal newline is not handled. Deliberately out of scope for this corpus.

    # is never counted and the size filter + counting together cost one fork.
    # (A `wc -c` per candidate would cost more than the counting it protects.)
    # `-size -50001c` keeps files of at most 50000 bytes — exactly the previous
    # `-gt 50000` skip; `-L` follows symlinks so the size measured is the size
    # grep would read.
